# Description of your program (part 7)
Starting with a count value of 0, begin with the upper left corner of the document and go through each character from left to right. Once you reach a character combination consisting of a letter directly followed by whitespace, add a 1 to the count value. Continue to scan through the document left to right, adding 1 to the count for every occurrence of this letter-whitespace combination until the final character in the document is reached. The count value will now be equal to the number of words in the document.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
I found this exercise interesting. It prompted me to carefully consider each step of a seemingly intuitive task in a systematic way. Thinking like this makes a lot of sense in regard to programming where a computer can't make assumptions like a human reader can. I found it satisfying to think through following these instructions exactly and whether or not they would result in a successful word count. I'm looking forward to this class to gain a deeper understanding of what's possible with technology and gain some of the background and tools that will help me continue to learn more about programming on my own in the future.
